# Movies API

A project focused on building an API with Node.js and SQLite. It creates a database for movies featuring titles, descriptions, ratings and genre tags. The users can create accounts, upload profile pictures and manage their movie ratings and descriptions. All of that using JWT Token and storing the user data in the database, encrypting the users passwords and storing sessions at the local storage in the web browser.

Everything is running locally for educational purposes.
